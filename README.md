# Address Standardization, Matching, and Verification Tool [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpelikan/postal-standardization.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpelikan/postal-standardization)

## Warning
**This project is very much a work in progress and cannot be used to standardize or validate postal addresses.**

## Standardization

Given an address in general string format, the tool will break down the parts of the address and attempt to identify
the street number, street, street type, unit, city, state, zip, etc. for the address.

Additionally, given an address object, the tool will generate a properly formatted address string.

Standardization does _not_ validate the address.

## Validation

Under development.

## Matching

Under active development.
